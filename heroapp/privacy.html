			We reserve the right to change this Policy at any time. We will notify you of any changes to this Policy by posting a new Policy to this page, and/or by sending notice to the primary email address specified in your account. You are advised to review this Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.

			This Policy does not apply to websites, apps, products, or services that we do not own or control, including the websites, apps, products, and/or services of our Customers (defined below). This means that this Policy does not explain what our Customers do with your information that we provide to them (or any information they collect directly from you, their End User (defined below)). Information provided to third parties, such as our Customers, are controlled by their respective privacy policies, which we encourage you to review for more information about their practices.<br><br>

				<b>How Do We Secure Your Personal Information?</b><br><br>

				We take reasonable steps to protect your Personal Information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, misuse, or destruction. Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. The safety and security of your Personal Information also depends on you. If you have an account with us, you are responsible for keeping your membership details confidential. Your account is protected by your account password and we urge you to take steps to keep your Personal Information safe by not disclosing your password and by logging out of your account after each use. We further protect your Personal Information from potential security breaches by implementing certain technological security measures including encryption, firewalls and secure socket layer technology.

By using the Services, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to assume these risks.<br><br>

				<b>Data Retention</b><br><br>

				When you place an order through the Services or participate in a transaction on the Services, we will retain your Account Information and any transaction information for our records unless and until you ask us to delete this information.

				<b>Managing Your Privacy</b><br><br>

				All users may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information furnished by a user in their user account by contacting us at support@hero.app or by accessing your user account.

For your protection, we may only share and update the Personal Information associated with the specific email address that you use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your identity before doing so. We will try to comply with such requests in a reasonably timely manner. If you completely and permanently delete all of your Personal Information, then your user account may become deactivated. If you wish to cancel your account, you may do so through your account page, and any personally identifiable information associated with your account will be deleted as soon as is reasonably practical or as required by applicable law. Please note that we may retain information that is otherwise deleted in anonymized and aggregated form, in archived or backup copies as required pursuant to records retention obligations, or otherwise as required by law.
